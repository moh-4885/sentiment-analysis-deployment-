5. Deployment Steps:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Initialize project (in your project directory)
vercel

# For production deployment
vercel --prod
```

Key Deployment Considerations:
1. Model Storage:
   - Create a `models/` directory in your project
   - Upload your pickle files to this directory
   - Ensure paths are correct in `load_models()`

2. Serverless Limitations:
   - Large model files might cause deployment issues
   - Consider using smaller models or model compression
   - Potential alternative: Use cloud storage like AWS S3 for model files

3. Additional Vercel Tips:
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configurations
   - Monitor function cold starts and performance
   - Consider upgrading to Pro plan for longer serverless function timeouts

Potential Enhancements:
- Add logging
- Implement more robust error handling
- Use cloud storage for model files
- Implement caching strategies

Troubleshooting:
- If deployment fails, check:
  1. Model file sizes
  2. Python version compatibility
  3. Dependencies in requirements.txt
  4. Vercel logs for specific errors

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the deployment process or help you address specific deployment challenges?
